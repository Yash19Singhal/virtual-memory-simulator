Virtual Memory Simulator

This project simulates page replacement algorithms used in Operating Systems for efficient virtual memory management. It highlights how different strategies handle page faults and manage memory frames using core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

Features

FIFO (First-In-First-Out) Page Replacement

LRU (Least Recently Used) Page Replacement

Optimal Page Replacement

Step-by-step visualization of memory states and page faults

Modular architecture with separate header (.h) and source (.cpp) files

Technologies Used

C++

Data Structures (Queues, Hash Maps, Arrays)

Operating System Concepts (Virtual Memory, Page Replacement)
